# App Description

I've tried to build code quiz program without using any instrunctional help from other people.
There are many errors in my program, For example, It doesn't turn into a submit page when the all questions are answered, it would change when user consumes given time. If guess are wrong many times, time will become negative. 
It saves username in the localstorage if I deploy only the submit html, however, It doesn't work along with the quizcard.html. I tried to fix all those errors, but got stuck and lost how to start to fix. Even I restarted from an empty page and build a new js pages, It was not working as I expected. Thus, I'm leaving the last version as the final work. I could have worked on the css and bootsctrap, instead, I decided to do more small and easy side projects and practice more vanilla JS!
